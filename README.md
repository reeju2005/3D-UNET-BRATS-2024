# 3D-UNET-BRATS-2024
This is the 3D Unet architecture for BRATS 2024.
Steps to run it:
1. Setup environment: All the necessary packages are being initialised. Preferably use Jupyter notebook. 
The link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation
2. Image data descriptions
All BraTS multimodal scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz) -> commonly used medical imaging format to store brain imagin data obtained using MRI and describe different MRI settings
T1: T1-weighted, native image, sagit
T1c: T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium) image, with 3D acquisition and 1 mm isotropic voxel size for most patients.
T2: T2-weighted image, axial 2D acquisition, with 2–6 mm slice thickness.
FLAIR: T2-weighted FLAIR image, axial, coronal, or sagittal 2D acquisitions, 2–6 mm slice thickness.
Data were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple (n=19) institutions.

All the imaging datasets have been segmented manually, by one to four raters, following the same annotation protocol, and their annotations were approved by experienced neuro-radiologists. Annotations comprise the GD-enhancing tumor (ET — label 4), the peritumoral edema (ED — label 2), and the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET — label 1), as described both in the BraTS 2012-2013 TMI paper and in the latest BraTS summarizing paper. The provided data are distributed after their pre-processing, i.e., co-registered to the same anatomical template, interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm^3) and skull-stripped.
